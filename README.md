# EDA_Project

## Overview

Aim of the project is predicting house prices in the area of Seattle/King County based on the Kings County Dataset. The Dataset contains 21 variables of 21597 houses. 

## Data Science Lifecycle

### 1 Business Understanding

Describes the variables in the King Country House Price Data 
Briefly look at data

### 2 Data Mining

Change datatype of variables in int/float

### 3 Data Cleaning

Show missing variables
Imputing missing data by k-Nearest Neighbors (k=2)
Splitting the dataset into training set and test set
Organize variables in categorial and continous

### 4 Data Exploration

Histogram for independent and dependent variables
Descriptive statistics
Correlation matrix of continous variables
R squared for each possible categorial explanatory variable
graphic representation (plot) between dependent variable and certain independent variables

### 5 Feature Engineering

Fitting Simple Linear Regression to the Training set
Predicting and visualizing results

### 6 Predictive Modeling

Predictive Modeling with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
Fitting model by using log of price as independant variable
create z-score variable for all variables (standardization)

### 7 Data Visualization

finf highest difference between predicted value and 'real' value
locate two recommendations with open street map

### Python Modules used:

Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly / math / statsmodels / sklearn / SciPy
